### **GGplot basics**

To create an empty, basic plot: 
```{r empty plot}
ggplot(data = iris)
```

You need to add so called aesthetics, with the mapping argument, you can add the variable you want on the x-axis and y-axis, but we will later see that there are much more aesthetics you can add such as colour.
```{r }
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```


This is the same and will save you some time when making a lot of plots.
```{r }
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```

The above codes will however still only make an empty graph because R does not know how to represent the data points of the variables. You will need to add a so called geometric object such as geom_point() to make a scatterplot or geom_bar() to make a bar graph. This is called adding a layer, and has to be done by using the +. We will first show a scatter plot example with different possibilities and will later show how to make any other types of plots.
```{r }
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + geom_point()
```

You can also add the aesthetics in the geometric object, and in the case below it will give you the same output. In some cases however it may prove useful to put other aesthetics to the geometric objects than you have already used in the ggplot(), for example when you want to add a prediction line. 
```{r }
ggplot(iris) + geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```
